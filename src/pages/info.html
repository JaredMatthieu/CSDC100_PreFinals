            <li class="question">
                What is Generative AI?
                <ul>
                    <li>“The term generative AI refers to computational techniques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content such as text, images, or audio from training data.”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="question">
                How does it work?
                <ul>
                    <li>It works by generating novel data instances based on learned patterns and behavior from the dataset.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="question">
                How is it made?
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s made by providing a large amount of data to a deep neural network to learn behaviors and patterns so that it could generate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="question">
                What's the difference between AI, ML, and GenAI?
                <ul>
                    <li>Artificial Intelligence is a field of study and technology of creating machines that mimic or surpass the intelligence of humans. Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that utilizes algorithms to learn from a set of data. Meanwhile, Generative AI is a subset of machine learning which focuses on creating new content from different sources such as text, images, or videos.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="question">
                What are examples of GenAI tools?
                <ul>
                    <li>Generative AI tools are those that provide responses to prompts or inputs. Examples include ChatGPT and MetaAI for x-text models; additionally, many of these text-based models are also x-image models that generate image or video outputs. ElevenLabs serves as an example of x-sound generative AI that produces audio or voice, while GitHub Copilot is an x-code model capable of generating code or fixing issues within it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="question">
                What can GenAI do (strengths)?
                <ul>
                    <li>Generative AI can be used to elevate the workforce by being able to assist in problems that may take a professional to do. They also have uses in programs and applications to have as an assistant to the user to automate tasks. Conclusively, Generative AI has a broad range of features that it can assist.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="question">
                What are its limitations or risks?
                <ul>
                    <li>It's limited in its form of being unable to understand keypoints on prompts that the model is not trained for. Thus, it takes resources in huge amount so that they could cover new data or ideas if required in the future.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>
